----------------------------------------

This code was built on Python 3.6
The following packages are required to run the experiments:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- csv
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- scipy
- time

----------------------------------------

In order to run this code you will need to be using a Python 3.6 environment with the list of dependecies having been installed (pip install X).

The two datsets are included as csv files. They are: credit-card-data.csv' and 'data/output/sampled-poker-hand-data.csv'

The file structure used was the following:
- unsupervised_learning.py
- figures/
- data/

Within unsupervised_learning.py just run and it should output all the tests and figures plus additional supporting data (eigenvaluese and kurtosis)

In order to run the code you must change directories to the parent folder and run (example):
python unsupervised_learning.py
